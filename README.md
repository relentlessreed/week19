# Installation

User only needs a working browser to use this application.

# Usage

Navigate in your browser to the deployed application url. You will be presented with an interface containing input fields for "Transaction", "Amount" "Add Funds", "Subtract Funds", a list of previous transactions and their amounts, and a dynamically responsive graph displaying all of the previously input data. This should help you whenever you are unable to use a wifi signal or your data plan. Once you reconnect to the internet after inputting items, the data will be synced and you practically should not even notice the app ever went offline in the first place. That, is the power of PWA's my friend!
